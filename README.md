# Blobs with Guns: Remastered

[Blobs with Guns](https://github.com/GutterCat42/blobs-with-guns-archive) is a game I made once in Godot 3. It was a cool idea and a horrible execution because my code was disgusting. This led to many performance issues and bugs, not to mention the fact that it was pure torture trying to add to my horrible code.

Anyway, so this time we're doing it again, but better.

**This project is currently in its earliest stages and I will update this README (and everything else) once I work out what I'm doing**
(Including some information on what the game is actually about)

### I am currently using [Godot 4.1.1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/tag/4.1.1-stable) to develop this game
